# Example of Progressive Web App

Shop example template build as [Progressive Web Apps](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/).

## Requirements

| Prerequisite      | How to check         | How to install
| ----------------- | -------------------- | ------------- |
| Node.js >= 6.11.5 | `node -v`            | [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org/) |
| npm >= 4.6.0      | `npm -v`             | [npm is distributed with Node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) |
| Yarn >= 1.6.0     | `yarn --version`     | [installation](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) |

## Features

* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) module bundler
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) the most popular HTML, CSS and JS framework

## Theme development

HTML Starter uses [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) as its build system.

### Tools

Building the template requires [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/). I recommend you installation to the latest 
version of [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install). From the command line run `yarn add package.json` 
(recommended) or `npm install`.

You now have all the necessary dependencies to run the build process.

### Available Webpack commands

* `npm run webpack` — Compile assets for developing (with source maps, without minify)
* `npm run watch` — Compile assets when file changes are made
* `npm run build` — Compile and optimize the files in your assets directory
